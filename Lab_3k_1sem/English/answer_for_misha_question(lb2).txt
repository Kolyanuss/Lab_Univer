We gathered here to talk about data struct
1) How to optimize the database to make it faster?
For the database to work quickly and correctly, you need to bring it to "normal form". 
This is called normalization of relations.
There are a total of 6 "normal forms", and a few small additional ones.

2) What is a relational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores 
and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, 
straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, 
each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. 
The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, 
and each record usually has a value for each attribute, 
making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

3) What do you know about basic SQL queries?
Well I know data output requests - its "SELECT".
It is designed to extract data from the table and display it on the screen.
There is also an edit type query. These include: Insert, Update and Delete.
Designed to insert, edit, and delete information similarly.
The next type of sql query is "formatting".
It includes: DISTINCT FROM WHERE IN AS ORDER_BY.
There are also logical queries, for example: AND OR LIKE

4) What is important to know in preparation for technical interviews.
In technical interviews, you will be asked to optimize your solution for time and space. 
You canâ€™t do that unless you have a solid understanding 
of how your code works and how data is stored and accessed.

This is probably the most important topic for coding interviews 
and you should prepare it well.
At a bare minimum, you should know about the array, linked list, 
binary trees, binary search tree, self-balanced trees like AVL tree, 
hash table(or map or dictionaries as known in Java and Python) stack, queue, and graph.
