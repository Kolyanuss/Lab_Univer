1. A: I'm thinking of buying a new computer.
B: But computers cost so much money. What's wrong with the one we've got?

5. A: I like musicals. And this is a great show, isn't it? Are you enjoying it?
B: Yes, I am. I love every minute of it.

6. A: I'm always falling asleep. I just can't keep awake.

B: Yes, certainly.
